## Overview

As a developer, I am constantly expanding my knowledge on a multitude of topics, and this repository reflects my ongoing journey. Currently, it contains my notes on a range of subjects. However, this is just a small selection of the many topics I am passionate about and actively pursuing.

I take notes for two simple reasons: they enhance my understanding of concepts and serve as a memory jogger when reviewing. Additionally, note-taking demonstrates my engagement and commitment to learning.

[The Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve](https://practicalpie.com/ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve/) is a well-known psychological concept that describes how our memory of information decreases over time without reinforcement. However, well-structured and detailed notes with examples and graphics can significantly improve our ability to remember what we've learned. By actively engaging with the material and organizing it in a visually appealing way, we increase the likelihood of retaining the information.
